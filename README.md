# Transcriptomics-analysis-pipeline
In this repository, I have put the R codes results, and plots of my capstone project of STEM-Away internship. In the capstone project, I performed meta-analysis of two lung cancer datasets named GSE19804 and GSE31210, then performed survival analysis for the hub genes of these combined datasets.
