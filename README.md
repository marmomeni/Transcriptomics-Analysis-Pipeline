# Transcriptomics-analysis-pipeline
In this repository, I maintain R codes and plots of my capstone project of an internship at STEM-Away company. In the capstone project, I have merged gene expression data from two lung cancer datasets named GSE19804 and GSE31210, and then done quality control, Functional enrichment analysis, GSEA, and gene concept analysis, afterthat performed survival analysis for the hub genes of these combined datasets.
