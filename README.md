# Transcriptomics-analysis-pipeline
In this repository, I maintain R codes and plots of my capstone project of an internship at STEM-Away company. In the capstone project, I performed a meta-analysis of two lung cancer datasets named GSE19804 and GSE31210, pathway and gene ontology analysis, GSEA, and gene concept analysis, then performed survival analysis for the hub genes of these combined datasets.
